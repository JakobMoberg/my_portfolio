1 Question1: Poker hand
1.1 Assumtions
1. Ace (A) can either be high or low in a straight I.E. (A-2-3-4-5 or 10-J-Q-K-A)
2. Straights excludes straight flushes.
1.2 Solution
Nr of possible ways to draw 5 cards from a deck:
52  51  50  49  48 = 311 875 200
Due to order of cards are irrelevant the number of hands is divided by 5! = 120.
311 875 200/120
= 2 598 960

Assumption 1 yields: Nr of straights =10

(A-2-3-4-5)
(2-3-4-5-6)
(. . . .)
(10-J-Q-K-A)

Each of the five cards in each straight can be any of the four suits. This gives us a
total of 10  4  4  4  4  4 = 10 240 possible straights. Assumption 2 yields that we need
to subtract the straight flushes. Thees are 40 of thees in total (9 in each color + royal
straight flush). Summing it up we end up with a total combination of relevant Straights:
10  4  4  4  4  4 - 4  9 - 4 = 10 200

1.3 Answer
The probably of a Straight hand in a 5 card poker hand is therefore:
10 200/2 598 960
= 0.392%

If we include Straight flush and royal straight flush:
10 240/2 598 960
= 0.394%

2 Question2: Lottery ticket
2.1 Solution
Expected value for a Ultra win lottery ticket:
E[U0] = 9 2/10+ 18  1/10+ (E[U1] + E[U2]) 1/10 + 0 6/10
Since the UWL tickets are uncorrelated and comes from the same distribution.

E[U0] = E[U1] = E[U2] := E[U] =>

E[U] = 9 2/10 + 18  1/10 + (E[U] + E[U]) 1/10 + 06/10 =>
E[U] = 36/10 + 2/10  E[U] => 8/ 10  E[U] = 36/10 => E[U] = 36/8 = 4 1/2

2.2 Answer
The expected value of a UltraWin lottery ticket is 4 1/2
Euros. This answer can be verified
by a simple recursive implementation and MC simulation. For 1 000 000 simulations we
get Esim[U] = 4.503951 which is close to our analytic solution of 4.5.

3 Question3: Uniform draw
3.1 Assumtions
1. The function randInteger(a) returns a uniform distributed random integer in the
interval [0, a) (inclusive 0 and exclusive a).
3.2 Answer
i=0
For(Element e : ARRAY)

{
	i++;
	if (randInteger(i) == 0){singleElement=e};
}
return singleElement;

3.3 Proof of correctness of algorithm
By induction:
n=1
Clearly the algorithm works since the first element will be chosen.
n ) n+1
We need to show that each element is chosen with probability 1
n+1 for the n + 1뭪h
iteration:
The last element can easily be seen to be chosen with probability 1/n+1. We therefore have a n/n+1 chance to keep the old value. Each of the n first element then also have a
n/(n+1)  1/n = 1/(n+1) probability to be chosen.

3.4 Time complexity
O(n), n being the number of elements in ARRAY since the randInteger(a) can be implemented
to be carried out in O(1) time.

4 Question4: Simulation exercise
4.1 Answer
Using the code found in code folder the simulation converges to Pwin = 11.7%. This
is reached after 1 000 000 simulations and increasing the number of simulations only
slightly change the results. See the code folder for java code
