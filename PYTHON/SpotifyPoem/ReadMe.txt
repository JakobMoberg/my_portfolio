This code reads a poem in the file "InputFile.txt"  
and generates a "OutputFile.txt" with a list of 
spotify uris that can be posted in a spotify 
playlist to reciece the matching songs.

It uses Queue, json, requests, math,threading and time -modules

See link for another implementation:

Example: input and output files can be find in this folder
